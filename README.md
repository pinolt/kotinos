# kotinos
VOC filter specifically designed for Ender Switchwire, but cross compatible with OEM SW.

This design is a modified [zerofilter](https://github.com/zruncho3d/zerofilter/), by zruncho.

The kotinos must be positioned ontop of the decks panels and on both sides of the bed (left and right).

If this is being installed in the Ender_SW:

Remove M5 washer inbetween M5X10 BHCS and deck. Replace with "kotinos core".

Proceed to install 4010 blower fan.
